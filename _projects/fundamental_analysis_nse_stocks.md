Welcome to my fun project, designed for educational purposes and personal enjoyment. In this project, I dive into the fascinating world of financial markets, aiming to learn and gain insights into 
the fundamental aspects of stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

Through this project, I embark on a journey of exploration, utilizing comprehensive fundamental analysis techniques to understand the intrinsic value and potential of various stocks. 
I gather and analyze a diverse range of financial information, including company financial statements, balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements, and key performance indicators.

By immersing in the analysis of these critical metrics, I aim to develop a deeper understanding of a company's financial health, growth prospects, profitability, and overall performance. 
This project provides an opportunity to apply our knowledge and learn how to evaluate stocks based on fundamental factors.

Please feel free to use the above web app to explore the fundamentals of different stocks.
