It is an innovative project that utilizes the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to decode emotions from recorded audio. Through the integration of Google's powerful speech-to-text API, I convert voice recordings into textual data, enabling me to perform emotion analysis with remarkable accuracy.

Using advanced machine learning algorithms, the system applies the renowned Ekman's six basic emotions modelâ€” happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise to classify and understand the underlying emotions expressed in the recorded voice. Extracting relevant acoustic features and leveraging NLP techniques enable technology to interpret human emotions more intuitively and empathetically.

This project holds immense potential across various domains, including mental health support, customer feedback analysis, and interactive voice systems. By recognizing emotions through voice, we can enhance the quality of interactions, enable personalized responses, and provide valuable insights for better decision-making.
