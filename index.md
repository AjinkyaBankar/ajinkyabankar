## Projects

- **Stock Price Forecasting using Temporal Fusion Transformer** - In this project, I employ advanced technique to predict stock prices accurately over time. Through temporal fusion modeling, I leverage temporal patterns and external factors to generate reliable forecasts, aiding in informed decision-making in the financial markets. The DOW JONES stocks prices for the next 5 days are predicted with a MAPE of 0.16.

- **Generative AI-Based Data Analysis for Evaluation of Variations in XPS Characteristics of MoS** - I developed a Large Language Model (LLM)-based assistant to aid my friend's research on MoS2 material. The XPS analysis for conformance of MoS2 revealed that there is significant variation in the Mo3d and S2p plots. The LLM assistant streamlines processes and enhances accuracy in XPS analysis. More details are available in the research paper [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10431152){:target="_blank"}.

- **Emotion Recognition from Voice using NLP** - This innovative project employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze emotions from voice recordings by leveraging Google's speech-to-text API, enabling accurate emotion decoding. Through advanced machine learning algorithms based on Ekman's six basic emotions model, including happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise, the system interprets emotions intuitively. With applications in mental health support, customer feedback analysis, and interactive voice systems, recognizing emotions from voice enhances interaction quality, enables personalized responses, and offers insights for decision-making.

- **Multi-Modal Shortest Path Optimization for Goods distribution** - Here I developed a shortest path algorithm considering transportation costs via road, rail, air, and ocean, coupled with storage and shortage costs, to determine the most cost-effective route for goods distribution in a complex retail network. The linear mathematical model is developed using PYOMO framework and Gurobi solver is used for achieving optimal solution.
