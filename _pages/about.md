Welcome! I am a Data Scientist with a Ph.D. degree from the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.fiu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Florida International University, where I was advised by [Dr. Gang Quan](http://web.eng.fiu.edu/gaquan/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests encompass Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Neural Network Sensitivity Estimation, Operations Research, Thermal/Power-aware Computing, and Advanced Real-Time Computing System Design.

Prior to my current role as a Data Scientist, I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics & Telecommunication in 2010 and a Master of Engineering in Electronics (Digital Systems) in 2013 from Savitribai Phule Pune University. From 2013 to 2018, I served as an Assistant Professor at Savitribai Phule Pune University in the Department of Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering at [Vidya Pratishthan's Kamalnayan Bajaj Institute of Engineering and Technology](https://vpkbiet.org/){:target="_blank"}. In Fall 2018, I began my doctoral studies at Florida International University.

During my academic journey at Florida International University, I had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed researchers such as [Dr. Vivek Chaturvedi](https://iitpkd.ac.in/people/vivek){:target="_blank"} from the Indian Institute of Technology, Palakkad, India, and [Dr. Shi Sha](https://www.wilkes.edu/campus-directory/shi.sha.aspx){:target="_blank"} from Wilkes University, Pennsylvania, USA.

As a Data Scientist, I work at [Crowley](https://www.crowley.com/){:target="_blank"}, a world-renowned logistics, shipping, and energy solutions company based in Jacksonville, Florida, USA. I work on high-impact projects, such as "Empty Equipment Positioning Optimization" and "Predictive Maintenance of Tug Boat Engines" by collaborating with various cross-functional teams of the business units. My expertise extends to programming languages such as Python, PyTorch, Matlab, as well as C, C++, Embedded C, VHDL, CPLEX, Gurobi, and tools like Dataiku, Snowflake, and PowerBI.

I invite you to explore my webpage and discover more about my contributions to the field of Data Science and Autonomous vehicle-related thermal-aware computing.
