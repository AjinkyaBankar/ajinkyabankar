A genetic algorithm-based approach is presented for effective peak temperature identification and computationally efficient system-wide lifetime reliability calculations for periodic automotive applications. We also present several computationally efficient techniques for system-wide MTTF computation, which show several-order-of-magnitude speed-up over the state-of-the-art method when tested using synthetic cases and practical benchmarks.
